# Self organising maps in MATLAB
A toolbox for creating self-organising maps (SOMs) in Matlab for image
segmentation. 
## Caution: On early development stages.
While the functions should work as intended, the scripts might contain 
calls to code that is not contained in this repository. Please refer any 
problems to the 
[issues page.](https://github.com/alonsoJASL/matlab.selforganisingmaps/issues)

### Simple input generation of self-organising maps
For the input generator code in `script_somtesting.m`, simple input data
like circles, crosses or squares was developed following
